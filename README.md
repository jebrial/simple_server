----------------------

** To run:
From terminal: go build

Just grab the executable and place it where you please.

Then at the commandline from the directory you put it:

./simple_server -directory=YOUR_ABSOLUTE_DIRECTORY_HERE

*Not for production unless you want ants... because that's how you get ants.
