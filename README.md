#Simple Server: for static single page AngularJS development
===========================================================

** To run:
From terminal: go build

Just grab the executable and place it where you please.

Then at the commandline from the directory you put it:

   `./simple_server <DIR>

* Or just run:
	`go run main.go <DIR>

*Not for production unless you want ants... because that's how you get ants.
